## How to run

Make sure you [have SBT installed](http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Setup.html) and a working Java run time installed.

1. Start the app with `$ sbt run`
2. Go to `localhost:9000` in 2 browser tabs/windows
3. Type into either one of the windows' input and hit enter and see that the messages show up in the other.
